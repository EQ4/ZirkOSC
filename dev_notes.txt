issue #42, j'ai une oscillation en xy que j'avais pas en rt. this also happens with octogris, right? yes. since when?
2.2.3: yes
2.1.3: yes    
2.0.15: yes
2.0.12: yes
it basically happened all the time, and nobody noticed...?

hypotheses
    * this will not happen with a pendulum going only in one direction
        * correct
the problem is only when READING the automations. so if there was a way that i could wait for pairs of xy values to be read before refreshing, it could help?

--setIsRecordingAutomation is set when we move a control. so in theory, if we are not recording automation, and setParameter is called, then we are reading an automation. 
--so what we can do is block the message thing between a setX and setY
that doesn't do anything. refresh is almost never blocked. 

the other hypothesis is that there's some error when reading the automation. so basically xyToAzimElev is not right. i could test a bunch of azim->xy->azim conversions
6 decimal places
