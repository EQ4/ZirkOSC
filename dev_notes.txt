issue #42, j'ai une oscillation en xy que j'avais pas en rt. this also happens with octogris, right? yes. since when?
2.2.3: yes
2.1.3: yes    
2.0.15: yes
2.0.12: yes
it basically happened all the time, and nobody noticed...?

hypotheses/tests
    * this will not happen with a pendulum going only in one direction
        * correct
   
   * the problem is only when READING the automations. 
        * so if there was a way that i could wait for pairs of xy values to be read 
          before refreshing, it could help?
        * setIsRecordingAutomation is set when we move a control. so in theory, if we 
          are not recording automation, and setParameter is called, then we are reading 
          an automation. 
        * so what we can do is block the message thing between a setX and setY
            * that doesn't do anything. refresh is almost never blocked. 

    * there's some numerical error when reading the automation. 
        * so basically xyToAzimElev is not right. i could test a bunch of azim->xy->azim 
          conversions
        * float = 6 decimal places
        * i did that, and smallest numerical error required to see oscillation is .001
          so very unlikely that this is the problem
    
    * ok. so the problem has to be when writing automations. basically, the y we write is not the one that goes with the x that we wrote. like there's a delay between storing x and storing y, which may be caused by the different daws. For instance, DP has no such oscillations.
